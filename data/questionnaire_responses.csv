I have found it to be very helpful in my classroom to generate notes for students and to help take my own work and put it into presentations formats, thus saving me time.

What truly defines a professional writer is not the use of AI chatbots, but rather the years of knowledge, exposure, and experience they have gained in their field. If we rely entirely on AI chatbots for writing, then anyone, even a layperson, could potentially become a ""professional"" writer overnight through the misuse of the AI for content creation, without possessing the foundational knowledge required for professional writing. While I appreciate the use of AI chatbots for tasks like editing, fact-checking, and other supportive roles, I don't think they should replace the expertise and creativity that come from human writers. AI chatbots are definitely valuable, but they are best used as tools to complement the skills of a professional."
